        2.&ensp; Rosetta Network Structure
      </h3>
      <p>
        The structure of the network is as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        &emsp; 1.&ensp; Researchers \(r_{1}, r_{2},...,r_{\left[ R\right]} \in R.\)
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp; 1.&ensp; Research items \(t_{1}, t_{2},...,t_{\left[ T\right]} \in T.\)
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        &emsp; &ensp; Each researcher has an associated set of research items which they have (co-)authored,
        and each research item has an associated set of researcher(s) who (co-)authored it. 
        Suppose that researcher \(r\) has a set of \(n\) research items. 
        Then we denote \(r\)’s research items as \(r^{1}, r^{2},...r^{n}\), and and refer to the collection of 
        research items as \(r^{*}\) . Likewise, suppose that research item \(t\) has \(m\) authors. 
        Then we denote \(t\)’s authors as \(t^{1}, t^{2},...t^{m}\) and refer to all the authors of \(t\) and \(t^{*}\).
